      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <span class = "text">
          Air pollution is the mixing of foreign substances to the whole atmospheric air.
        Harmful and toxic gases emitted by the industries and motor vehicles causing huge damage to the living organisms whether plants,
        animals or human beings. Some of the natural and various human resources are causing air pollution.
        However, most of the air pollution sources are stem out of the human activities like burning fossil fuels, coal and oil,
        release of harmful gases and substances from factories and motor vehicles.
        Such harmful chemical compounds like carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide,
        sulphur dioxide, solid particles, etc are getting mixed to the fresh air.
        The level of air pollution has become increased by great extent because of 690% increase in damaging pollutants because of the expanded need of motor vehicles from last century.

      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <span class = "text">
            The ever increasing level of air pollution also enhances its negative and harmful effects to the health of living beings.
         Air pollution is causing global warming to increase because of increasing atmospheric temperature due to the increasing level of green house gases.
         Such green house gases again causing green house effect and forcing sea levels to increase, glaciers to melt, weather to change, climate to change, etc. 
         <br>Increasing air pollution is causing many lethal diseases (cancer, heart attack, asthma, bronchitis, kidney diseases, etc) and death to occur. 
         Various important animals and plants species have been destroyed completely from this planet. Increasing level of harmful gases in the environment are causing the occurrence of acid rain and depleting the ozone layer.

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <span class = "text">
        The only way to control current environmental issues is to implement conservation methods and create sustainable development strategies. 
        We should find some effective solutions in order to restore our ecological balance.
        First of all, we should make sustainable transportation choices. We should take advantage of public transportation, walk or ride bikes whenever possible, consolidate our trips,
        and consider purchasing an electric car. 
        People should conserve energy. Consider what small changes can lead to big energy savings.
        Use energy efficient devices. It is also essential to understand the concept of reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Buy reusable items. Remember that almost everything that you purchase can be recycled.
        Conserve water as much as possible. Dispose of toxic waste properly. Do not use herbicides and pesticides. Use natural, environmentally friendly chemicals for your everyday chores.
